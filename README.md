# PDF Keyword Extractor

This Python script extracts meaningful keywords from PDF files using two NLP techniques:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) with spaCy
- Keyword extraction using KeyBERT

Keywords are written to an `output.txt` file for further use in applications such as resume parsing, content analysis, or document indexing.

## 📦 Requirements

The script uses the following Python libraries:

- [`PyMuPDF (fitz)`](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) – for reading PDF files
- [`KeyBERT`](https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT) – for extracting keywords using BERT embeddings
- [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/) – for Named Entity Recognition
- `os` – built-in Python module for file path handling

You’ll also need to download the `en_core_web_sm` spaCy model.
